# VOTR IO

This is the repo for process management. No significant code. Maybe some documentation?

## Mission Statement

Whether voting on what to order for lunch or for the highest offices in government, we believe that ranked-choice voting produces fairer, more democratic results. We believe that when people understand a thing they cannot be made afraid of it, and they can make their own judgements about it. We believe that ranked-choice voting is a better system and that it can and should win on its own merits. 

Our goal is build a simple, focused platform for creating and running ranked-choice polls and elections, which will be freely available to anyone. In this way we can promote the accessibility of democratic processes everywhere, and expose and educate a broader audience on ranked-choice voting systems.

## Principles

- No monetization. This is a volunteer, non-profit project. While we reserve the right in the future to request donations or otherwise offset the direct financial cost of hosting, there is no thought or intention of monetizing this project. Never introduce a financial conflict of interest.
- Respect security and privacy. Never capture or store any user information that is not directly necessary & relevant to the process of administering polls and elections. Never contact users when is not directly necessary & relevant to the process of administering polls and elections, or maintenance of their own data. 
- Uphold democratic principles. Ballots are anonymous. Election results and even raw ballot data should be available to all participants. Take all feasible steps to protect the integrity of the voting process. Do not compromise on this principle even when it may force us to have harder conversations.
- Total transparency, except where it would directly violate the above principles. All code is open source; all of our management process, prioritization, and decisions are open source. Within our product, always provide a clear and transparent explanations for how and why.
